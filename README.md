# SiteOpener
The nature of this program is to open one of the websites in a text file randomly.
When the program runs, it will attempt to alphabetize and fix links with a prefix if necessary and remove link repeats.

Use:
1) The sites.txt file must be in the same folder as the source code if launching from command line.
2) If launching from an IDE as project, the sites.txt file will usually need to be right outside the text file.

SiteOpener is a working title for the project.
